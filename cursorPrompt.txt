Fix these issues in the code:
1. Typo in 'box-shdow' property
2. Unclosed </h2> tag
3. Add padding to feature list items
4. Make padding consistent
5. Add hover transition effect
6. Center-align card content
7. Make component reusable with parameters

Refactor into a function that takes:
- title (string)
- price (string)
- features (array of strings)
- buttonText (string)

Return the HTML as a string. Include all CSS inside the component.
